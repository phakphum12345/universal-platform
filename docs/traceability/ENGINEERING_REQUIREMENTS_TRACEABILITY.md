# Engineering and 3D Requirements Traceability

**Status:** Proposed mapping baseline with one narrow executable kinematics slice verified by PR #12; not implementation evidence for broader requirements.

## Status

CAD-003A is IMPLEMENTED as a narrow analytic 2R planar serial-arm adapter and merged in PR #12 at 0379c8613c7668a56b681a91d01882c66f1c812c. PR head e5f8511b14cd72ecb930ffd08ccb7f916cb71056 passed PR run #82 and push run #81; merge commit passed post-merge push run #83. The documentation-only marker was SKIPPED in each run, not PASS.

CAD-003A does not close general CAD-003. All other listed requirements remain PROPOSED / NOT IMPLEMENTED / NOT VERIFIED until source and test evidence exists. Existing HWR-001..HWR-006 remain separately defined in docs/hardware/.

## Evidence and governance gates

- Documentation coverage is not implementation evidence.
- Implemented means source exists; PASS requires executed evidence tied to an exact SHA and reproducible procedure.
- SKIPPED and UNKNOWN are never PASS.
- A narrow analytic 2R test suite does not certify arbitrary mechanisms or physical feasibility.
